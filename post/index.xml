      <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning I departed Malaga in magnificent weather - no clouds and temperatures around 23 degrees. With a group of London-based friends we&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last 5 days in El Chorro - a classic winter-sun destination, mostly visited by English and German climbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://martinov.github.io/images/2016-02-el-chorro/P2188670.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;El Chorro&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with Jon we arrived in Malaga on Thursday, a day before the others. The plan was to have a look around, get familiar with the area and put some climbs in the bag. The weather wasn&amp;rsquo;t cooperating so we had to take it easy and be satisfied with the mystical views the rain and clouds had to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way to El Chorro we picked up a hitchhiker, a guy from Greece who was going to meet some friends and do the Caminito del Rei with them. He was living in Granada during the winter season to learn Spanish, as he&amp;rsquo;s working in the Greek tourism industry only during the summer. His dream was to sell ice cream on a little Greek island and told us he had just received the licence for that. We had a few beers at the bar next to El Chorro’s train station, and left somewhat unimpressed with the food they served us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We checked out some routes on the major crags around the village - &lt;a href=&#34;https://ukclimbing.com/logbook/crag.php?id=2488&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Frontales&lt;/a&gt;
 and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ukclimbing.com/logbook/crag.php?id=2485&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Las Encantadas&lt;/a&gt;
 and found the Olive Branch B&amp;amp;B. It looked quite good, prices were reasonable and it was full with like-minded people. We asked for places but it was pretty much full so we decided to stick with the initial plan which was to camp. For this purpose I had selected a VW Caddy from the rental car company, a vehicle with enough space for two people to have a comfortable night in. And it would have been pretty comfy if we had brought sleeping bags and mats with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having a great dinner in the Rocabella restaurant, we parked the car in the forest near Frontales and put most of our clothes on. We removed the back seats but couldn&amp;rsquo;t fit them in the front, so the bigger one remained stored in the back. It was a cold night and we had to start the engine at some point to warm up. I was even able to get some sleep, despite the few walks Jon had to make out in the rain. Unfortunately the next day wasn&amp;rsquo;t drier and again we couldn&amp;rsquo;t climb. We drove off to the upper dam and had a look further along the road, where the entrance for Caminito del Rei is supposed to be. Then we went back to Malaga, to pick up Romina and Marti, who arrived after lunch. Together we went grocery shopping, then wandered around El Chorro and went to pick up the keys for the villa which Zhivko had booked. The other part of the crew arrived late in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://martinov.github.io/images/2016-02-el-chorro/P2198741.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;Caminito del Rei&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of us gathered for breakfast and a short discussion on where to climb that day followed. Marti suggested a new sector, not included in the guidebooks yet - Cucina Caliente, just above the Olive Branch, and we decided to give it a go. It was a good option for our group - everyone had something interesting to do - there are 11 routes there, from 5 to 6b+. I was satisfied at the end of the day because I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to do all of them onsight. We had a great day out and a nice evening in the villa, where Romina cooked a delicious paella.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://martinov.github.io/images/2016-02-el-chorro/P2208756.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;Romina leading one of the routes at Cucina Caliente&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the next day we woke up early with Romi and went to do a nice long route in the middle of Frontales - Lluvia de asteroides (6a, 250m). I led all the 8 pitches, nice climbing on mostly solid rock, felt a bit easy for the grade. We reached the top for 6 hours, including a lunch break after the 4th pitch, which was a point of commitment for us, as we only had a single 70m rope, and that pitch was 39 meters long. But we didn&amp;rsquo;t had any issues to the top, where we easily found the rappel anchors for the way back. We had some problems finding the way to get down but eventually, after following some goat paths, walking down a dry river canyon, crossing a train bridge and climbing a fence we found ourselves at the lower car park. I was proud with Romina&amp;rsquo;s performance this day as this was her first multipitch route ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third (and last) day of climbing was not that fruitful, but also nice. The highlight for me was a route called Putiferio, a real 3 star pitch, 30 meters, hard for the grade. I&amp;rsquo;ve also tried a 6a and 6b+ but couldn&amp;rsquo;t do them clean because we had to take Romi to the airport. I guess I was a bit tired from the previous two days. We should have rested that day but there was nothing to test for as we were flying away on the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We woke up this morning and had an awesome breakfast outside on the terrace. Then Jon went for a shower and we left for the airport. At this point we&amp;rsquo;ve realised it&amp;rsquo;s a bit late, so I had an excuse to do 180 km/h on the highway. We&amp;rsquo;ve managed to get to the airport on time and I ran off to find my gate. Jon was flying later so he got the responsibility to return the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I am, halfway through the flight to London, contemplating on the El Chorro experience. It was a good one for sure, but there were some glitches too. If it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for the nice winter climate around Malaga, I&amp;rsquo;d say Vratsa is a better climbing destination. Similar amounts of rock, a lot of potential for new routes in both places, but not so crowded and no sign of electrical companies and constant humming of cables in the air in Vratsata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to the Mallorca trip in March, but before that we&amp;rsquo;ll do a short one to Greece.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I broke my back</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been two weeks since I got out of the hospital. I’ve spent a night in the emergency and a week and a half in the Major Trauma unit. I’ll have to wear a TLSO brace for another three weeks. I shouldn’t be complaining because that’s the minimum, before the operation the doctors were saying it could be 10 or more weeks until my back is stable enough to go unsupported. Everything went well with the operation and according to the doctor, my recovery is also going excellent for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember everything from the night of the accident. We were climbing at the Westway. That’s the indoor climbing wall I’m visiting after work every other day. I was with my regular climbing partner Rado, his girlfriend Milena, his nephew Toni and some other people, one of them a guy whom I’ll call Flamen.
Milena and Toni are relatively new to climbing, just taking their first steps in leading so together with Rado they&amp;rsquo;ve dedicated the evening to practice falling. He was belaying and showing them different techniques. While they were resting, he was climbing with me, we were trying some challenging routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point Rado went to see how his people are doing. It was half past nine and we had another half an hour to call it a day. I’ve decided to do some easy routes in that remaining time. Have you heard that most climbing accidents happen in the end of the day, or on the way down from a climb? Flamen was up for belaying me, so we started. I’ve climbed up an easy 6a and then down-climbed it, to start immediately another one. When I got down, I pulled the rope, had a look at Flamen to see if he had put the rope correctly through his belay device and started the next one. I did this a few times. I was getting tired but that was the idea, to carry on as long as I can. And then it happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was two clips away from the top, something like 30 ft (10m) from the ground. I saw the next move is going to be hard for me in my current state, had a quick look down and saw I’ve got some slack and my belayer is talking to somebody. Instead of shouting “watch me”, or grabbing an easier hold from another route, or a quickdraw, or something else, I tried to do the move. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of time in the past to train my brain to be able to give everything I have to the route I&amp;rsquo;m climbing. I was probably subconsciously hoping that although my belayer is not paying attention, he’ll catch my fall because he was using a Trango Cinch (an assisted-braking belay device, similar to Petzl Grigri). &amp;ldquo;I might pull him off a bit but he’ll catch me.&amp;rdquo; Wrong! I don’t remember the actual flight after I got off the wall. I lost consciousness when I hit the ground. When I got back from this strange land of mixed rainbow lights and sounds, there was a small group of people around me. My friends, two other regular climbers and a member of the staff. They&amp;rsquo;ve later told me I wasn&amp;rsquo;t there for about 40 seconds. I was laying on the floor and someone was holding my head and telling me to not move. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling any pain, I remember slowly understanding what had happened and telling them everything is OK and that I&amp;rsquo;m fine. Somebody had already called for an ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;ve untied me from the rope and also removed the belay device from the other end. People later told me that the guy from the staff has inspected everything and it was all set up correctly. Nobody had any idea about what exactly had happened. My belayer didn&amp;rsquo;t knew I was falling until I&amp;rsquo;ve hit the ground next to him. He didn&amp;rsquo;t had any burns or other traces from the rope on his hands so everyone thought he wasn&amp;rsquo;t holding the dead end when I fell. He was probably holding the Cinch incorrectly, that’s the most commonly expressed assumption. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s a combination of that and the fact that he&amp;rsquo;s not very experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve met Flamen three or four months ago at the wall. He was a coming with another guy, they were beginners but visiting regularly and our group is always friendly to strangers, especially when they&amp;rsquo;re from the same nationality. So we started belaying each other in the gaps when we didn&amp;rsquo;t had our regular partner around. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few falls on hard routes and Flamen didn&amp;rsquo;t had any problems catching them. Unfortunately I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to learn anything from him about the accident. Two days after it happened he visited me in the hospital but wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to say anything meaningful or answer any of my questions. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t harsh with him or anything, I only wanted to understand a bit more about what had happened. I haven’t heard from him since then. This speaks a lot about the type of person he is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we have a saying in Bulgaria that bad things don&amp;rsquo;t go alone. Something else happened shortly after this. It was emotionally much more painful than breaking some bones. It&amp;rsquo;s about a girl I was in love with and I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it off of the internet. Why I&amp;rsquo;m mentioning it then? Because my point is - when an accident like this happens to you, you&amp;rsquo;re forced to learn. For example, you learn to only put your life in the hands of people you truly trust. But more importantly, you learn a lot about the people around you. It&amp;rsquo;s sad that some people choose the easy way out, but that&amp;rsquo;s their own problem after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, my friends, my family, my colleagues were with me all the time, supporting me from the first day in the hospital. They were helping me by any means they could think of. It is a great thing to know that there are people who actually care and it&amp;rsquo;s inevitable to feel that everything will be all right in the end if you&amp;rsquo;re surrounded by such a group of colourful and awesome personalities. I am humbled and deeply thankful to each one of them for the responsiveness and sympathy they are giving me every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a lucky escape! During the surgery they&amp;rsquo;ve put &lt;a href=&#34;https://martinov.github.io/images/x-ray/image1.jpg&#34;&gt;two rods and 6 screws&lt;/a&gt; in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://martinov.github.io/images/x-ray/image2.jpg&#34;&gt;vertebrae&lt;/a&gt;, and they didn&amp;rsquo;t touch the lower fracture, which later turned out to be a good decision, as the doctor observed it&amp;rsquo;s healing properly on it&amp;rsquo;s own. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be fully recovered soon. But there are people who die because of belayer errors. Don&amp;rsquo;t trust everyone, just because they&amp;rsquo;ve got a harness and can put a rope through the belay device properly. Be safe and take care of your partners!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also have a look at the funny video below to see how NOT to belay:&lt;/p&gt;
